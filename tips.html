          <p><span>Test the Soil:</span> Before planting, test the pH and nutrient levels of your soil. Plants grow best in soil that is slightly acidic to neutral (pH 6-7).
          <br>
          <span>Improve Soil Quality:</span> Add organic matter like compost, well-rotted manure, or peat moss to improve soil texture and fertility. This improves drainage and provides essential nutrients.
          <br>
          <span>Aerate the Soil:</span> Loosen compacted soil by tilling it or using a garden fork. This allows roots to grow more easily and promotes better water drainage.

      </div>

      <div class="full">
        <div class="point1">
          <p><span>Water at the Right Time:</span> Water your plants early in the morning or late in the evening to avoid evaporation during the hottest parts of the day.
          <br>
          <span>Deep Watering:</span> Water deeply and infrequently rather than shallow and frequently. This encourages roots to grow deeper, making them more drought-resistant.
          <br>
          <span>Use Mulch:</span> Apply mulch around plants to retain moisture, regulate soil temperature, and prevent weed growth.

      </div>

      <div class="full">
        <div class="point2">
          <p><span>Plant at the Right Depth:</span> Always plant seeds or seedlings at the recommended depth. Planting too shallow or deep can prevent proper growth.
          <br>
          <span>Spacing Plants Properly:</span> Give plants enough room to grow by following recommended spacing guidelines. Overcrowding can reduce airflow, leading to disease and poor growth.
          <br>
          <span>Use Raised Beds:</span> If you have poor soil or limited space, raised beds provide better drainage and control over soil conditions.

      </div>

      <div class="full">
        <div class="point3">
          <p><span>Prune Regularly:</span> Trim dead or damaged branches to improve airflow and reduce the risk of disease. For fruiting plants, pruning helps encourage more growth and production.
          <br>
          <span>Deadhead Flowers:</span> Remove spent flowers from your plants (called "deadheading") to promote further blooming. This is especially useful for flowering plants like roses and marigolds.

      </div>

      <div class="full">
        <div class="point4">
          <p><span>Encourage Beneficial Insects:</span> Natural predators like ladybugs, lacewings, and predatory beetles can help control pests. Planting flowers like dill or fennel can attract these helpful insects.
          <br>
          <span>Use Neem Oil or Insecticidal Soap:</span>  For organic pest control, neem oil and insecticidal soap are safe options for dealing with pests like aphids or spider mites.
          <br>
          <span>Hand-pick Pests:</span> For small infestations, manually remove pests from plants. This method is labor-intensive but avoids the use of chemicals.

        <div class="point5">
          <p><span>Know Your Growing Zone:</span> Understanding your USDA plant hardiness zone can help you select plants that are suited to your area's climate.
          <br>
          <span>Protect from Frost:</span> In colder climates, consider using row covers, cloches, or cold frames to protect plants from late frost.
          <br>
          <span>Heat Stress:</span> In hot climates, provide shade for heat-sensitive plants by using shade cloths or planting taller plants that can offer natural protection.

      </div>

      <div class="full">
        <div class="point6">
          <p><span>Choose the Right Containers:</span> Ensure your containers have proper drainage holes to avoid waterlogging.
          <br>
          <span>Use Quality Potting Mix:</span> Avoid using garden soil, which can be too heavy for containers. Instead, use a lightweight potting mix designed for container gardening.
          <br>
          <span>Water Regularly:</span>  Plants in containers tend to dry out faster than those in the ground, so monitor their water needs more closely.

          <p><span>Composting Basics:</span> Composting organic waste (like kitchen scraps and yard waste) creates nutrient-rich soil for your garden. Balance green materials (nitrogen-rich) with brown materials (carbon-rich).
          <br>
          <span>Turn the Pile:</span> Turning your compost regularly will help aerate it and speed up the decomposition process.
